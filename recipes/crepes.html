    <p>Bring Paris to your kitchen with these delicious berries & cream filled crepes. For presentation and extra deliciousness, add chocolate syrup on top.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Cup All Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>1/4 Cup Sugar</li>
            <li>1 Cup 2% Milk</li>
            <li>1/4 Cup Water</li>
            <li>1/4 Cup Melted Butter</li>
            <li>2 Eggs</li>
            <li>2 Cups Mixed Berries of Your Choice</li>
            <li>Chocolate Drizzle, as Desired</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine flour, sugar, milk, water, melted butter, and eggs. Whisk the mixture until smooth, cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Lightly coat an 8-inch nonstick skillet with additional butter or nonstick spray; head over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Spoon slightly less than 3 tablespoons of batter in the center of the pan; tilt and rotate to cover the entire bottom of the pan (6 inches). Cook until the top is dry and the edges are starting to brown.</li>
            <li>Loosen the edges with a rubber spatula. Flip the crepe over to brown on the other side. Carefully slide the scraper under the crepe and remove to a clean plate. Repeat until batter is used (~16 crepes).</li>
            <li>Stack crepes within squares of waxed paper between layers.</li>
            <li>To serve the crepes, spoon about 1/4 cup berries in each crepe and fold. Top with chocolate drizzle as desired and enjoy!</li>
