        <li>In a medium bowl, combine flour, sugar, milk, water, melted butter, and eggs. Whisk the mixture until smooth, cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Lightly coat an 8-inch nonstick skillet with additional butter or nonstick spray; head over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Spoon slightly less than 3 tablespoons of batter in the center of the pan; tilt and rotate to cover the entire bottom of the pan (6 inches). Cook until the top is dry and the edges are starting to brown.</li>
        <li>Loosen the edges with a rubber spatula. Flip the crepe over to brown on the other side. Carefully slide the scraper under the crepe and remove to a clean plate. Repeat until batter is used (~16 crepes).</li>
        <li>Stack crepes within squares of waxed paper between layers.</li>
        <li>To serve the crepes, spoon about 1/4 cup berries in each crepe and fold. Top with chocolate drizzle as desired and enjoy!</li>
